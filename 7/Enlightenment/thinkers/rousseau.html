    <!-- BACKGROUND -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Background">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          A Swiss-French thinker, Jean-Jacques Rousseau is often considered one of the most important philosophers of the Enlightenment.
          He focused on a big question: <b>what should the relationship be between a government and its people?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Rousseau believed that governments are not “automatically” allowed to rule just because someone is born into power.
          Instead, leaders only have power when people agree to it—because the government is supposed to serve the people.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- THE SOCIAL CONTRACT -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="The Social Contract">
      <div class="section">
        <h2><i>The Social Contract</i> (1762)</h2>

        <p>
          In 1762, Rousseau wrote <i>The Social Contract</i>, where he explained that government exists as a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An agreement between people and their leaders: people obey laws, and leaders protect rights.">contract</span>
          between the people and their ruler.
        </p>

        <p>
          To Rousseau, the deal was simple: the people allow a ruler to rule in exchange for
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Safety from threats and harm.">protection</span>
          and
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Being safe and stable—free from danger and chaos.">security</span>.
          As long as the ruler protects the people’s rights, the ruler keeps power, the people are satisfied, and the contract stays intact.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- DID YOU KNOW (placed near best reference: Social Contract ideas threatening rulers) -->
    <section class="didYouKnow" aria-label="Did you know feature">

        <img src="/assets/images/ui/didyouknow.png" alt="Did you know" width="200" height="78" />
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
        Even though Rousseau wrote about freedom and the people’s power, he spent much of his life arguing with other Enlightenment thinkers—and didn’t always get along with them.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- NATURAL RIGHTS CONNECTION -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Natural Rights Connection">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Natural Rights and Keeping the Contract</h2>

        <p>
          Rousseau argued that the contract only works when the ruler protects the natural rights of the people.
          He connected his ideas to the same natural rights John Locke had written about decades earlier:
          <b>life</b>, <b>liberty</b>, and <b>property</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If those rights are protected, the contract stays strong. But if a ruler violates people’s rights, the government is breaking the contract—and Rousseau
          believed the people can respond.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- BREAKING THE CONTRACT -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Breaking the Contract">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Breaking the Contract</h2>

        <p>
          Rousseau stated that if a ruler breaks the contract and violates individuals’ natural rights, then the people can
          <b>change</b>, <b>alter</b>, or even
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="To remove a government by force; to take power away from rulers.">overthrow</span>
          their government—or break away and form a new one.
        </p>

        <p>
          The point wasn’t that people should overthrow governments all the time. It was that government is only legitimate when it protects rights.
          If it stops doing that, it loses the reason it exists.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- INFLUENCE -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Influence on 1776 and elections">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Influence on the United States and Elections</h2>

        <p>
          This idea helps explain the creation of the United States. In 1776, the 13 colonies felt their natural rights were being
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Taken away or limited unfairly.">infringed upon</span>,
          broke from Britain, and formed a new country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rousseau’s contract idea also connects to elections today. Each time we hold elections, we are expressing—on a smaller scale—our view of the contract.
          If people choose a new leader, it is often because they no longer feel their rights are being protected as well as they should be.

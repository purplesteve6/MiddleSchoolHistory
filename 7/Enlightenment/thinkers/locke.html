      <div class="section">
        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          John Locke was an English
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A person who studies big questions about ideas, truth, and how society should work.">philosopher</span>
          during the Enlightenment who focused on the structure of governments. Locke believed that people were naturally kind and, when given the choice,
          would help others before helping themselves. In other words, he thought most people could use
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Careful thinking based on evidence and logic.">reason</span>
          to solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since people were naturally good at heart, Locke believed that a strict government was not necessary. He argued that communities could work out
          problems by openly compromising with one another. For Locke, a good government doesn’t exist to control every part of life—its purpose is to set
          fair rules, settle disputes, and protect people from having their rights violated.

    <!-- TWO TREATISES -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Two Treatises of Government">
      <div class="section">
        <h2><i>Two Treatises of Government</i> (1690)</h2>

        <p>
          In his famous book on government, <i>Two Treatises of Government</i> (1690), Locke wrote about the relationship between government and its people.
          He challenged the idea that kings should rule with unlimited power. Instead, Locke argued that government should be based on an agreement between
          the people and the leaders who govern them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Locke believed that a government’s power should come from the people’s
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Permission or agreement. In government, it means people allow leaders to rule.">consent</span>.
          If leaders are supposed to protect the people, then leaders must follow laws and rules too. If they do not, the government is no longer doing its job.

      </div>
      <div class="fact">
        Many kings and rulers feared Locke’s ideas—because he argued that people could replace a government that refused to protect their rights.

    </section>

    <!-- NATURAL RIGHTS -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Natural Rights">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Natural Rights</h2>

        <p>
          In <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>, Locke wrote about what he called
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Basic rights you are born with; not granted by government.">natural rights</span>—rights that are granted to you by nature
          (or God) upon birth. These rights, Locke argued, are not given to you by government and, as a result, government cannot take them away.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rights that all people have, according to Locke’s natural rights, are the right to <b>life</b>, <b>liberty</b>, and the right to own
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Things people own, such as land, money, or belongings.">property</span>.
          Locke believed that the main job of government is to protect these rights. If government protects rights, people will usually accept its authority.
          If it violates rights, it loses the trust of the people.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- INFLUENCE -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Influence on 1776">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Influence on the Declaration of Independence</h2>

        <p>
          Locke’s ideas traveled far beyond England. American colonists read Enlightenment thinkers and used their arguments to explain why a government
          should not have unlimited power. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson would borrow Locke’s words when he wrote that all people have
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Rights that cannot be taken away.">inalienable rights</span>
          (rights that cannot be taken away), such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jefferson changed Locke’s wording slightly—Locke listed “property,” while Jefferson wrote “pursuit of happiness.” But the key idea stayed the same:
          people have rights that exist before government, and government’s job is to protect them.

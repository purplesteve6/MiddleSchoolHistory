          John Locke was an English philosopher of the Enlightenment who argued that governments should exist to

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          John Locke was an English
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A thinker who asks big questions about ideas like government, knowledge, and ethics.">philosopher</span>
          during the Enlightenment who focused on the structure of governments. Locke believed that people were
          naturally kind and, when given the choice, would help others before helping themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since people are naturally good at heart, Locke believed that a strict government was not necessary.
          According to Locke, people could work out problems by openly
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="To give up a little so both sides can agree.">compromising</span>
          with one another. In other words, government should not exist to control people’s lives—it should exist
          to protect them and keep society fair.

        Locke’s ideas were considered dangerous by many kings—because he argued that people could replace a government

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Locke’s Ideas About Government</h2>

        <p>
          In his famous book,
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A 1690 book by John Locke explaining government’s purpose and limits.">Two Treatises of Government</span> (1690),
          Locke wrote about the relationship between government and its people. Locke argued that governments should be limited
          and that rulers should not have unlimited power.
        </p>

        <p>
          Locke believed that governments get their authority from the people—the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The idea that government power comes from the people agreeing to it.">consent of the governed</span>.
          If people agree to follow laws, the government must protect their rights in return. This idea connects to the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An agreement: people obey laws, and the government protects their rights.">social contract</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- NATURAL RIGHTS (main content text you provided, integrated + supported with vocab hovers) -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Natural Rights">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Natural Rights</h2>

        <p>
          In his book, Locke described what he called
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Basic rights you are born with, not given by government.">natural rights</span>—rights that are granted to you
          by nature (or God) upon birth. These rights, Locke argued, are not given to you by government and, as a result,
          government cannot take them away.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rights that all people have, according to Locke’s natural rights, are the right to
          <b>life</b>, <b>liberty</b>, and the right to own
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Things a person owns, like land, belongings, or money.">property</span>.
          Locke believed protecting these rights was the main job of government. If a government refuses to protect them,
          it is acting unfairly—and people may need to change it.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- CONNECTION TO DECLARATION -->
    <section class="card full" aria-label="Connection to the Declaration of Independence" id="connections">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Connection to the Declaration of Independence</h2>

        <p>
          Locke’s ideas helped inspire the American Revolution. In <b>1776</b>, Thomas Jefferson borrowed Locke’s words
          when writing the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson wrote that all people have
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Rights that cannot be taken away.">inalienable rights</span>,
          such as <b>life</b>, <b>liberty</b>, and the <b>pursuit of happiness</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though Jefferson changed Locke’s wording slightly (Locke said “property”), the main idea stayed the same:
          governments exist to protect rights—and when they fail, people can demand change.
        </p>

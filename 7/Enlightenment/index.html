        <h2>What Was the Enlightenment?</h2>

        <p>
          The Enlightenment was an intellectual movement that spread across Europe in the 1600s and 1700s. Many thinkers believed that people
          could improve society by using
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Careful thinking based on evidence and logic.">reason</span>
          instead of relying only on tradition or authority. They asked big questions:
          <i>What makes a government fair?</i> <i>What rights should everyone have?</i> <i>When is it okay to change a government?</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Enlightenment writers often criticized
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A government where one ruler has almost total power.">absolute monarchy</span>
          and supported ideas like
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A government’s power should come from the people.">popular sovereignty</span>
          and
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An agreement between rulers and the people: the people obey laws, and the government protects their rights.">social contract</span>.
          Their books, essays, and debates spread through coffeehouses and
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Gatherings (often in homes) where people discussed art, science, and politics.">salons</span>,
          helping ideas travel across borders.
        </p>

        <p>
          These ideas mattered far beyond Europe. American colonists read Enlightenment authors and used their arguments when creating a new country.
          When the United States wrote its Constitution, it built a government designed to protect liberty and limit power.

        <h2>Connections to the Declaration of Independence &amp; the U.S. Constitution</h2>

        <div class="mediaRow">

            <img src="images/doi_drafting.webp" alt="Drafting the Declaration of Independence" />

          <div class="mediaText">
            <p>
              Enlightenment ideas helped shape two key American documents: the <b>Declaration of Independence</b> (1776) and the
              <b>U.S. Constitution</b> (1787). The Declaration explains <i>why</i> the colonists believed they could break away from Britain,
              and the Constitution explains <i>how</i> the new government would work—while preventing
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Cruel or unfair use of power.">tyranny</span>.
            </p>

            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>
                <b>John Locke:</b> People have
                <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Basic freedoms people are born with, like life and liberty.">natural rights</span>.
                The Declaration echoes this idea with “life” and “liberty,” and the claim that government exists to protect rights.
                If a government violates rights, people can change it—an idea connected to the
                <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An agreement between rulers and the people: the people obey laws, and the government protects their rights.">social contract</span>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Charles Montesquieu:</b> To stop abuse of power, government should be divided into parts. The Constitution uses
                <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Dividing power among branches (like legislative, executive, and judicial).">separation of powers</span>
                so no one person or group controls everything.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Jean-Jacques Rousseau:</b> Legitimate government should reflect the people. The Declaration talks about government based on the people’s agreement,
                and the Constitution begins with “We the People,” tying to
                <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A government’s power should come from the people.">popular sovereignty</span>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Mary Wollstonecraft:</b> Enlightenment ideas about rights raised an important question: <i>Who counts?</i> Wollstonecraft argued that women should have
                education and rights too. Over time, Americans used Enlightenment language about equality and rights to push for expanding rights to more people.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Together, these documents show Enlightenment influence in two ways: the Declaration argues for <b>rights and justified government</b>,
              and the Constitution builds a system designed to <b>limit power</b> and protect liberty through structure and laws.

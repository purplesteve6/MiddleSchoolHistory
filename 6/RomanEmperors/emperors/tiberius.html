        <h2>Who is Tiberius?</h2>

        <p>
          Tiberius was Rome’s second Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span>.
          He was the step-son of Augustus and a successful general long before becoming emperor.
          When Augustus died in <b>14 CE</b>, Tiberius took over a massive empire that was still adjusting to rule by one person.
          Unlike Augustus, Tiberius did not seek power eagerly and often seemed uncomfortable with the role.
        </p>

        <h3>A Reluctant Ruler</h3>
        <p>
          Tiberius was known for being serious, disciplined, and private.
          Ancient writers describe him as someone who preferred military service over politics.
          Even after becoming emperor, he sometimes spoke as if he did not want absolute authority.
          This <span class="vocabWord" data-def="unwillingness to do something">reluctance</span> earned him respect from some Romans but confusion from others, who expected the emperor to lead confidently and publicly.
        </p>

        <h3>Government, Fear, and Distrust</h3>
        <p>
          Tiberius kept the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Rome’s advisory council made up of elite citizens.">Senate</span>
          involved in government, but he did not fully trust it.
          Over time, accusations of treason increased, and political trials became more common.
          Many Romans feared being labeled an
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Someone accused of threatening the government.">enemy of the state</span>,
          which created a tense political climate.
        </p>

        <h3>Sejanus and Withdrawal from Rome</h3>
        <p>
          Tiberius relied heavily on an advisor named
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A powerful official who served as Tiberius’s chief advisor.">Sejanus</span>.
          When Tiberius later believed Sejanus was plotting to take power, Sejanus was executed.
          After this betrayal, Tiberius became even more suspicious.
          In his later years, he withdrew from Rome and ruled from the island of
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An island where Tiberius lived during his later reign.">Capri</span>.
          Tiberius matters because he proved the empire could survive after Augustus—but also showed how fear and isolation could weaken leadership.

        <h2>Who is Constantine?</h2>

        <p>
          Constantine (often called <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A nickname meaning “the Great,” given to someone remembered as very important.">Constantine the Great</span>) was a Roman
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from <b>306–337 CE</b>.
          He lived during a time when the Roman Empire was divided and unstable. Several leaders ruled different regions, and
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Wars fought between people of the same country.">civil wars</span> were common.
          Constantine rose to power as a general and defeated his
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="People who compete for the same power or position.">rivals</span> one by one until he became the main emperor.
        </p>

        <h3>Constantine and Christianity</h3>
        <p>
          Constantine is especially important because of his connection to
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A religion based on the teachings of Jesus.">Christianity</span>.
          Before the <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A famous battle in 312 CE that helped Constantine gain power.">Battle of the Milvian Bridge</span> in <b>312 CE</b>,
          Constantine believed he saw a Christian symbol in the sky and thought the Christian God would help him win.
          After his victory, he supported the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An order that made it legal for Christians to practice their religion in the Roman Empire.">Edict of Milan</span>,
          which ended punishment of Christians and allowed them to worship openly.
          Constantine also built churches, supported Christian leaders, and called the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A meeting of Christian leaders to settle disagreements about beliefs.">Council of Nicaea</span>
          to help unify Christian teachings across the empire.
        </p>

        <h3>A New Capital for a Changing Empire</h3>
        <p>
          Constantine made another important decision by moving the capital to
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A city rebuilt by Constantine that became the center of the Eastern Roman Empire.">Constantinople</span>.
          This city was easier to defend than Rome and was located near important trade routes between Europe and Asia.
          It was also closer to wealthy eastern provinces and active armies.
          After Constantine’s death, the eastern half of the empire grew stronger and survived long after the west fell.
          This eastern empire became known as the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The eastern Roman Empire that lasted for many centuries.">Byzantine Empire</span>.
          Because of these choices, Constantine is remembered as a major
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A moment when history changes direction.">turning point</span>
          in Roman and world history.

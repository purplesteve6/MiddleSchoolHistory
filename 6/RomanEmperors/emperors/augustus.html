        <h2>Who is Augustus?</h2>

        <p>
          Augustus was the first
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span>
          of Rome. He was born <b>Octavian</b> and became the adopted son of Julius Caesar.
          After Caesar’s assassination, Rome fell into
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A civil war is a war between groups inside the same country.">civil wars</span>
          because powerful leaders fought for control.
        </p>

        <h3>How He Gained Power</h3>
        <p>
          Octavian teamed up with Mark Antony and Lepidus in the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A triumvirate is a group of three leaders who share power.">Second Triumvirate</span>.
          Over time, Octavian defeated his rivals and became the most powerful leader in Rome.
          In <b>27 BCE</b>, the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The Senate was a powerful council of Roman leaders and lawmakers.">Senate</span>
          gave him the title <b>Augustus</b>, which means “the honored one.”
        </p>

        <h3>A New Kind of Government</h3>
        <p>
          Romans hated kings, so Augustus avoided calling himself one. Instead, he kept the old
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A republic is a government where leaders are chosen and power is shared (at least in theory).">republic</span>
          looking “alive” by letting the Senate meet and vote. But he made sure he controlled the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Legions were Rome’s professional soldiers, organized into large units.">legions</span>
          (the army), and that gave him the biggest power.
        </p>

        <h3>Peace and Prosperity</h3>
        <p>
          Augustus helped bring stability after years of fighting. This began the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The Pax Romana was a long period of relative peace and stability across the Roman world.">Pax Romana</span>
          (“Roman Peace”). During this time, trade improved and travel became safer.
        </p>

        <h3>Building Rome</h3>
        <p>
          Augustus supported building projects to make Rome look strong and organized. These projects also created jobs and made the city more impressive.
        </p>

        <h3>Why He Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Augustus mattered because he helped change Rome from a republic into an
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An empire is many lands ruled by one central government.">empire</span>
          led by one main ruler. The system he created lasted for a long time—even after he died.

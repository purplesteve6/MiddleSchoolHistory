        <h2>Who is Augustus?</h2>

        <p>
          Augustus was the first <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> of Rome.
          He was born <b>Octavian</b> and became the adopted son of Julius Caesar.
          After Caesar’s assassination, Rome fell into <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A civil war is a war between groups inside the same country.">civil wars</span>
          because powerful leaders fought for control.
        </p>

        <h3>How He Gained Power</h3>
        <p>
          Octavian teamed up with Mark Antony and Lepidus in the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A triumvirate is a group of three leaders who share power.">Second Triumvirate</span>.
          Over time, Octavian defeated his rivals and became the most powerful leader in Rome.
          In <b>27 BCE</b>, the <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The Senate was a powerful council of Roman leaders and lawmakers.">Senate</span>
          gave him the title <b>Augustus</b>, which means “the honored one.”
        </p>

        <h3>A New Kind of Government (How He Made It Work)</h3>
        <p>
          Romans hated kings, so Augustus avoided calling himself one. Instead, he kept the old
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A republic is a government where leaders are chosen and power is shared (at least in theory).">republic</span>
          looking “alive” by letting the Senate meet and vote.
          But he also made sure he controlled the <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Legions were Rome’s professional soldiers, organized into large units.">legions</span>
          (the army), and that gave him the biggest power.
        </p>
        <p>
          One example: Augustus created a more organized way to run Rome’s provinces (the lands Rome controlled).
          Provinces that needed lots of soldiers were often under his direct control, so he could keep the army loyal and the borders protected.
        </p>

        <h3>Peace and Prosperity</h3>
        <p>
          Augustus helped bring stability after years of fighting. This began the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The Pax Romana was a long period of relative peace and stability across the Roman world.">Pax Romana</span>
          (“Roman Peace”). During this time, trade improved and travel became safer.
          For example, Roman roads connected cities and helped merchants move goods (like grain and olive oil) more easily.
        </p>

        <h3>Building Rome (Real Examples)</h3>
        <p>
          Augustus supported big building projects to make Rome look strong and organized.
          For example, he repaired temples, improved public spaces, and helped build monuments that reminded people of Rome’s power.
          These projects also created jobs and made the city more impressive to visitors.
        </p>

        <h3>Why He Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Augustus mattered because he helped change Rome from a republic into an
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An empire is many lands ruled by one central government.">empire</span>
          led by one main ruler. The system he created lasted for a long time—even after he died.

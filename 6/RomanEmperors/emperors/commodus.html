        <h2>Who is Commodus?</h2>

        <p>
          Commodus was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from
          <b>180–192 CE</b>. He was the son of Marcus Aurelius, a leader many people admired for his self-control and duty. Because of that,
          Romans expected Commodus to be a careful ruler too. Instead, Commodus often cared more about being celebrated than about doing the hard
          work of governing. He also spent huge amounts of money on games and gifts to keep crowds happy and loyal. His reign is remembered as a
          time when the emperor’s choices started to weaken trust in Rome’s leadership.
        </p>

        <h3>Fame, Shows, and Power</h3>
        <p>
          Commodus loved games, parties, and big public spectacles. He enjoyed being the center of attention and wanted people to cheer for him.
          Most emperors tried to look serious and responsible, but Commodus wanted to look like a hero in a story. He sometimes dressed like the
          god Hercules and expected others to praise him. While crowds might have enjoyed the entertainment, running an empire required planning,
          listening to good advice, and solving problems far away from Rome.
        </p>

        <h3>Corruption and a Violent Ending</h3>
        <p>
          Commodus often let powerful helpers make decisions for him. Some of these advisers were
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Dishonest or unfair use of power, usually for money or advantage.">corrupt</span>,
          meaning they used their jobs to gain money and influence. Commodus also became obsessed with fighting as a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A trained fighter who battled in arenas for entertainment.">gladiator</span>,
          which embarrassed many Romans because emperors were expected to lead, not perform. In the end, Commodus was
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Killed suddenly, usually for political reasons.">assassinated</span> in <b>192 CE</b>.
          After his death, Rome entered a period of confusion and conflict. Many historians see Commodus’s reign as part of a long
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A gradual weakening over time.">decline</span> in strong Roman leadership.

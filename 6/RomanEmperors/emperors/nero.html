        <h2>Who is Nero?</h2>

        <p>
          Nero was Rome’s fifth Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span>.
          He became emperor in <b>54 CE</b> when he was still a teenager.
          Early in his reign, experienced advisors helped him govern, and the empire remained mostly calm.
          At first, Nero was seen as a promising young ruler.
        </p>

        <h3>Entertainment and Image</h3>
        <p>
          Nero loved music, theater, and public games.
          He wanted to be admired as a talented performer as well as a ruler.
          Some Romans enjoyed the entertainment, but others believed an emperor should focus more on leadership and governing.
          Over time, Nero’s focus on performance caused many people to question his priorities.
        </p>

        <h3>The Great Fire of Rome</h3>
        <p>
          In <b>64 CE</b>, a massive fire destroyed large parts of the city of Rome.
          This disaster is known as the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A devastating fire that burned much of Rome in 64 CE.">Great Fire of Rome</span>.
          After the fire, Nero organized rebuilding projects and redesigned parts of the city.
          However, rumors spread that Nero was responsible for the fire.
          Although historians still debate whether this was true, the rumors damaged public trust in his leadership.
        </p>

        <h3>Growing Trouble and Rebellion</h3>
        <p>
          A major turning point in Nero’s reign came when he ordered the death of his mother,
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Nero’s mother, who helped him become emperor and advised him early in his rule.">Agrippina the Younger</span>,
          in <b>59 CE</b>.
          She had helped Nero gain power and advised him when he was young.
          As Nero grew older, he feared her influence and wanted full control.
          After her death, many Romans lost trust in Nero, and his rule became more feared.
        </p>

        <p>
          As opposition grew, powerful leaders in the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Regions of the Roman Empire outside the city of Rome.">provinces</span>
          led <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Uprisings against the government.">rebellions</span> against him.
          In <b>68 CE</b>, Nero lost support and took his own life.
          His death ended the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Rome’s first imperial family, descended from Augustus.">Julio-Claudian dynasty</span>
          and led to a period of confusion over who should rule next.

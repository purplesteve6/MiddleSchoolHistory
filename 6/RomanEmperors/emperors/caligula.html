        <h2>Who is Caligula?</h2>

        <p>
          Caligula was Rome’s third Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span>.
          His real name was Gaius, and he was the son of the popular general
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A respected Roman general and Caligula’s father.">Germanicus</span>.
          When Emperor Tiberius died in <b>37 CE</b>, many Romans hoped Caligula would be a kind and generous ruler.
          At first, those hopes seemed justified.
        </p>

        <h3>A Popular Start… Then a Dark Turn</h3>
        <p>
          Early in his reign, Caligula gave money to the people, held public games, and canceled unfair trials.
          However, after a serious illness, his behavior changed.
          Roman writers describe him as becoming suspicious, cruel, and unpredictable.
          He ordered the execution of people he believed were disloyal, including senators and even members of his own family.
          This showed how dangerous it could be when one person held unlimited power.
        </p>

        <h3>Violence and Abuse of Power</h3>
        <p>
          Caligula often used fear to control others.
          He demanded absolute loyalty and punished those who questioned him.
          Some sources say he forced senators to humiliate themselves,
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Using authority to take property away from someone.">confiscated</span> property,
          and used executions to silence rivals.
          He also spent large amounts of money on luxury and entertainment, causing financial strain.
          While some stories may have been exaggerated by later historians, most accounts agree that violence and fear were common during his rule.
        </p>

        <h3>How His Reign Ended</h3>
        <p>
          Caligula ruled for only about four years.
          In <b>41 CE</b>, he was
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="To be murdered, usually for political reasons.">assassinated</span>
          by members of the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Elite soldiers responsible for protecting the emperor.">Praetorian Guard</span>,
          the same group meant to protect him.
          Caligula matters because his reign reminds us that when leaders rule through fear instead of trust, governments can quickly fall into chaos.

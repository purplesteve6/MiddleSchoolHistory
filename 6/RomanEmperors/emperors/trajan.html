        <h2>Who is Trajan?</h2>

        <p>
          Trajan was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from
          <b>98–117 CE</b>. He is often remembered as one of Rome’s strongest and most successful rulers.
          Trajan was also the <b>first emperor who was not born in Italy</b>. He came from a province in Spain, showing that the empire
          was becoming more diverse and that leadership could come from outside the city of Rome.
        </p>

        <h3>Rome at Its Greatest Size</h3>
        <p>
          Trajan was a skilled military commander who believed expansion would strengthen the empire.
          Through successful wars, especially against the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A powerful kingdom north of the Danube River.">Dacians</span>,
          Trajan added new territories and valuable resources.
          Under his rule, the Roman Empire reached its greatest
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The total land area controlled by an empire.">territorial size</span>.
          While expansion brought wealth and power, it also made the empire harder to defend because its borders stretched so far.
        </p>

        <h3>Building for Power and Pride</h3>
        <p>
          Trajan believed that strong leadership should be visible. He supported massive building projects in the city of Rome,
          including <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A large public center built by Trajan for government and daily life.">Trajan’s Forum</span>.
          One of the most famous monuments from his reign is
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A tall stone column carved with scenes from Trajan’s military victories.">Trajan’s Column</span>,
          which tells the story of his wars and celebrates Roman strength.
        </p>

        <h3>Helping the People</h3>
        <p>
          Trajan also worked to improve daily life for Roman citizens. He supported programs that provided food and money to families and children,
          helping keep people loyal to the empire.
          His reign is often remembered as part of the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A long period of peace and stability in the Roman Empire.">Pax Romana</span>,
          when Rome was wealthy, powerful, and mostly at peace.
          Trajan matters because he shows how an emperor could be both a successful general and a builder who cared about the people.

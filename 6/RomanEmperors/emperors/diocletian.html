        <h2>Who is Diocletian?</h2>

        <p>
          Diocletian was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from
          <b>284–305 CE</b>. He came to power during one of the worst periods in Roman history, known as the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A time of chaos when Rome faced invasions, civil wars, and economic problems.">Crisis of the Third Century</span>.
          During this time, the empire struggled with foreign invasions, rebellions, and rapid changes in leadership.
          Diocletian’s main goal was to restore order and keep the empire from falling apart.
        </p>

        <h3>Ruling a Huge Empire</h3>
        <p>
          Diocletian believed the empire was too large for one person to rule alone. To solve this problem, he created the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A system of rule with four emperors sharing power.">Tetrarchy</span>,
          meaning “rule of four.” Under this system, there were two senior emperors called
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Senior emperors who shared top authority.">Augusti</span>
          and two junior emperors called
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Junior emperors trained to take over later.">Caesars</span>.
          Each ruler governed a different region and commanded local armies.
          This helped the empire respond faster to threats and reduced civil wars for a time.
        </p>

        <h3>Laws, Money, and Religion</h3>
        <p>
          Diocletian also worked to fix Rome’s economy. He changed the tax system and tried to control prices with new laws,
          hoping to stop inflation and shortages. At the same time, he believed traditional Roman gods protected the empire.
          Because of this, he ordered the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.">Great Persecution</span>
          of <span class="vocabWord" data-def="People who followed the Christian religion.">Christians</span>,
          demanding that they worship Roman gods or face punishment.
          Diocletian eventually retired voluntarily—something very rare for a Roman emperor—but the systems he created strongly influenced later rulers, including Constantine.

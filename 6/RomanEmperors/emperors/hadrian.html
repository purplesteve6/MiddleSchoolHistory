        <h2>Who is Hadrian?</h2>

        <p>
          Hadrian was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from
          <b>117–138 CE</b>. Unlike some earlier emperors, Hadrian did not focus on conquering new land.
          Instead, he believed the Roman Empire had grown large enough and needed to be protected and managed more carefully.
          His reign shows a shift from expansion to stability.
        </p>

        <h3>Protecting the Empire’s Borders</h3>
        <p>
          Hadrian believed Rome should defend what it already controlled. He strengthened forts and defenses along the edges of the empire,
          known as the <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The outer edges of an empire where it meets other lands.">borders</span>.
          His most famous project was
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A long stone wall built across northern Britain to defend the Roman border.">Hadrian’s Wall</span>,
          built in Britain. This wall helped control movement, stop raids, and clearly mark where Roman land ended.
          It showed that Rome was focused on defense rather than conquest.
        </p>

        <h3>Traveling the Provinces</h3>
        <p>
          Hadrian spent much of his reign traveling throughout the empire. He visited distant
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Regions of the Roman Empire outside the city of Rome.">provinces</span>
          to inspect armies, meet local leaders, and solve problems.
          This hands-on leadership helped keep the empire organized, even far from the city of Rome.
          His travels helped people across the empire feel connected to Roman rule.
        </p>

        <h3>Building and Culture</h3>
        <p>
          Hadrian also supported art, architecture, and learning. He rebuilt important buildings, encouraged education, and admired Greek culture.
          Many of his projects helped maintain peace during the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A long period of peace and stability in the Roman Empire.">Pax Romana</span>.
          Hadrian matters because he showed that strong leadership can come from protecting borders, improving daily life, and keeping peace—not just winning wars.

        <h2>Who is Romulus Augustulus?</h2>

        <p>
          Romulus Augustulus was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The western half of the Roman Empire, including Italy and parts of Europe.">Western Roman Empire</span>
          from <b>475–476 CE</b>. What makes him especially unique is that he was very young—probably only
          <b>about 14 years old</b> when he became emperor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Romulus did not gain power because he was a great leader. Instead, his father,
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A powerful Roman general who helped place his son on the throne.">Orestes</span>,
          was a military commander who placed his son on the throne so he could rule behind the scenes.
          Because of this, Romulus had very little real control over the empire.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Was His Reign So Short?</h3>
        <p>
          By the late 400s CE, the Western Roman Empire was in serious
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="To become weaker over time.">decline</span>.
          The government struggled to collect taxes, the army depended on foreign soldiers, and different groups competed for power.
          In <b>476 CE</b>, a Germanic military leader named
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A Germanic leader who removed Romulus Augustulus from power in 476 CE.">Odoacer</span>
          removed Romulus from the <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The position of a ruler or king.">throne</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Is He Important?</h3>
        <p>
          Even though Romulus ruled for only about a year, he is remembered as the
          <b>last emperor of the Western Roman Empire</b>. His removal marks an important
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A moment when history changes direction.">turning point</span>
          in history. Roman rule continued in the east, but the west would never again have a Roman emperor.

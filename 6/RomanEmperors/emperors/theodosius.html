        <h2>Who is Theodosius I?</h2>

        <p>
          Theodosius I was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from
          <b>379–395 CE</b>. He came to power during a difficult time, when the Roman Empire was under pressure from
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Groups from outside the Roman Empire who moved into Roman territory.">barbarian invasions</span>
          and internal conflict. Theodosius is especially important because he was the
          <b>last emperor to rule both the eastern and western halves</b> of the Roman Empire.
        </p>

        <h3>Christianity Becomes the Official Religion</h3>
        <p>
          One of Theodosius’s most important actions involved religion. Earlier emperors like Constantine had supported
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A religion based on the teachings of Jesus.">Christianity</span>,
          but Theodosius went further. In <b>380 CE</b>, he issued a law known as the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A law that made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire.">Edict of Thessalonica</span>,
          which made Christianity the official religion of the empire.
          Pagan worship was discouraged, and Christian leaders gained more influence in government.
          This decision permanently changed Roman society and shaped European history for centuries.
        </p>

        <h3>The End of a United Empire</h3>
        <p>
          Theodosius also faced serious military challenges. After Roman forces were defeated at the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A major Roman defeat by Gothic forces in 378 CE.">Battle of Adrianople</span>,
          he made agreements with some Germanic groups, allowing them to settle inside the empire in exchange for military service.
          When Theodosius died in <b>395 CE</b>, he divided the empire between his two sons.
          The eastern half, centered on Constantinople, remained strong, while the western half grew weaker and eventually fell.
          Because of his decisions, Theodosius represents a major
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A moment when history changes direction.">turning point</span>
          in the story of Rome.

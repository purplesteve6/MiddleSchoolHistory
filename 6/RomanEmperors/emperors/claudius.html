        <h2>Who is Claudius?</h2>

        <p>
          Claudius was Rome’s fourth Roman
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span>.
          He came to power in <b>41 CE</b> after the assassination of Caligula.
          During the confusion that followed, the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Elite soldiers responsible for protecting the emperor.">Praetorian Guard</span>
          unexpectedly chose Claudius as the new ruler.
          Many Romans were surprised by this decision, as Claudius had never been seen as a likely emperor.
        </p>

        <h3>Underestimated… but Capable</h3>
        <p>
          Claudius was often underestimated because he was quiet and did not act like a traditional military strongman.
          Some Romans believed he was weak or unfit to rule.
          However, Claudius proved to be a careful and thoughtful leader.
          He paid close attention to details, listened to advisors, and focused on making the government work more efficiently.
          Over time, he earned respect for his steady leadership.
        </p>

        <h3>Improving Government and Control</h3>
        <p>
          Claudius strengthened the empire by expanding the use of
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Government workers who manage records, laws, and communication.">bureaucrats</span>.
          These officials helped manage laws, taxes, and messages across the empire.
          This made it easier for Rome to control distant
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Regions of the Roman Empire outside the city of Rome.">provinces</span>
          and keep the government organized.
        </p>

        <h3>Conquest and Building</h3>
        <p>
          Claudius also expanded the empire by ordering the Roman
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The process of taking control of new land by military force.">conquest</span>
          of
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An island north of Gaul that became a Roman province.">Britain</span>
          beginning in <b>43 CE</b>.
          This victory increased Rome’s territory and improved Claudius’s reputation.
          He also supported major building projects, including roads, harbors, and aqueducts, which improved daily life.
          These efforts helped maintain stability during the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A long period of peace and stability in the Roman Empire.">Pax Romana</span>.
          Claudius matters because he showed that careful organization and steady leadership could be just as powerful as charisma.

        <h2>Who is Marcus Aurelius?</h2>

        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius was a Roman <span class="vocabWord" data-def="An emperor is the top ruler of an empire.">emperor</span> who ruled from
          <b>161–180 CE</b>. He is often remembered as one of Rome’s “good emperors” because he tried to rule fairly and responsibly.
          However, his reign was not peaceful. Marcus Aurelius spent much of his time dealing with wars, disease, and problems along Rome’s borders.
          His rule shows that even strong leaders can face serious challenges.
        </p>

        <h3>A Philosopher on the Throne</h3>
        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius is unique because he was also a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A person who studies ideas about life, behavior, and how to live well.">philosopher</span>.
          He followed a philosophy called
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A philosophy that teaches self-control, duty, and accepting things you cannot change.">Stoicism</span>,
          which taught that people should focus on duty, self-control, and doing what is right.
          Marcus wrote his thoughts in a personal journal known as
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A famous book written by Marcus Aurelius about how to live a good life.">Meditations</span>,
          which is still read today. His ideas emphasized responsibility, kindness, and service to others.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges and Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          During his reign, Rome fought difficult wars against Germanic tribes along the northern borders.
          At the same time, the empire was struck by a deadly disease called the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A deadly disease that spread through the Roman Empire during Marcus Aurelius’s reign.">Antonine Plague</span>,
          which killed millions and weakened the empire’s economy and army.
          Marcus Aurelius tried to hold the empire together during these crises.
          After his death in <b>180 CE</b>, his son Commodus became emperor and ruled poorly.
          Many historians see Marcus Aurelius’s death as the beginning of a long
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A gradual weakening over time.">decline</span>
          in Roman leadership.

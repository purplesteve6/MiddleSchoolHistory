        <h2><center>How Did Caesar Rise?</center></h2>

        <p>
          Rome was a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A republic is a government where citizens (or representatives) choose leaders and power is shared among different groups.">republic</span>,
          which meant leaders were supposed to share power. The
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The Senate was a powerful council of Roman leaders and lawmakers.">Senate</span>
          debated laws, and elected officials (like
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The two highest elected officials in the Roman Republic, who served together as head-of-state.">consuls</span>)
          served short terms. But by Caesar’s time, Rome had huge territory, lots of money, and big problems—especially inequality
          and conflict between powerful families.
        </p>

        <h3>The Triumvirate: Power Shared (and Controlled)</h3>
        <p>
          One reason the republic struggled was that powerful men sometimes formed alliances to “share” influence behind the scenes.
          Caesar became part of a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A triumvirate is an alliance of three powerful leaders who work together (often to control politics).">triumvirate</span>
          with Pompey and Crassus. Even though Rome still had elections and the Senate, this partnership helped them push decisions through,
          gain important jobs, and reward supporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The triumvirate did not last. When Crassus died and Caesar’s relationship with Pompey collapsed, rivalry turned into open conflict—one
          more step toward civil war and one-man rule.
        </p>

        <h3>Military Success = Political Power</h3>
        <p>
          Caesar became famous by winning battles in
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Modern day France and other nearby areas.">Gaul</span>.
          His army became loyal to <i>him</i>, not just to Rome. In a republic, this was dangerous—because a leader with loyal soldiers could pressure
          the government. When the Senate ordered Caesar to give up his command, Caesar chose war instead.
        </p>

        <h3>The Civil War and One-Man Rule</h3>
        <p>
          In 49 BCE, Caesar crossed the Rubicon River and marched toward Rome, starting a civil war. He defeated Pompey and became the most powerful man
          in Rome. Caesar was named
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Dictator means a ruler with total power. In Rome, it was supposed to be temporary, but Caesar’s power lasted too long.">dictator</span>
          for life. Many senators feared he would become a king.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ides of March</h3>
        <p>
          On March 15, 44 BCE (the Ides of March), Caesar was stabbed to death by a group of senators. They claimed they were saving the republic,
          but the assassination caused more civil wars instead of peace.

        <h2>From Caesar to the Emperors</h2>
        <p>
          After Caesar died, Rome did not return to normal republic government. More civil wars broke out. Caesar’s adopted heir,
          Octavian (later called Augustus), eventually won and became Rome’s first emperor. That’s why Julius Caesar is often seen
          as the turning point: he showed how one leader could take control of the republic’s system.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Roman Emperors</h3>
        <p>
          Not every emperor is remembered equally. Some stand out because they founded a new system, expanded Rome, brought long periods of peace,
          faced major crises, or ruled during turning points.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="emperors/augustus.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> — the first emperor; created the “new” Roman system after the republic’s collapse.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> — a capable but suspicious ruler; shows how fear could grow under emperors.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/caligula.html"><b>Caligula</b></a> — remembered for cruelty and instability; a warning about unchecked power.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a> — improved government and expanded Rome; often underestimated by enemies.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> — famous for scandal and harsh rule; remembered as a symbol of decline and chaos.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> — led Rome to its greatest territorial size; often viewed as a strong military emperor.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> — focused on defending borders and strengthening the empire.</li>
          <li><a href="emperors/marcus-aurelius.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a> — philosopher-emperor; known for duty during difficult wars and crises.</li>

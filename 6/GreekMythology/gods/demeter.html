        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          Demeter is the goddess of agriculture, fertility, and the harvest. She is deeply connected to the cycle of
          life and nature, ensuring that crops grow and seasons change. Her most famous myth revolves around the
          abduction of her daughter Persephone, which helped the ancient Greeks explain why the world turns green in
          spring and summer but grows cold and barren in fall and winter. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
        </p>

        <p>
          Symbols associated with Demeter include wheat, the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A horn-shaped container overflowing with food; a symbol of plenty.">cornucopia</span>,
          and the torch. She was widely worshiped across Greece, especially through the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Secret religious ceremonies in Eleusis honoring Demeter and Persephone and the cycle of life.">Eleusinian Mysteries</span>,
          a sacred festival and set of rites that focused on life, death, and rebirth. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>

        <p>
          Demeter is sometimes shown as a calm, powerful mother figure—because so many of her myths center around
          caring for Persephone. But she is also a force of nature. When Demeter is satisfied, fields are full and
          people are fed. When she grieves, the land can become empty and harsh.

        <h2><center>The Abduction of Persephone</center></h2>

        <p>
          Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, loved wandering through meadows and picking flowers with her friends.
          One day, as she reached for a particularly lovely bloom, the ground beneath her split open. Out of the
          darkness emerged Hades, the god of the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The realm of the dead ruled by Hades.">underworld</span>,
          in his chariot. Before Persephone could escape, he swept her away into his shadowy kingdom. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
        </p>

        <p>
          Demeter did not know what happened at first. She searched the earth, calling Persephone’s name again and
          again, but no one answered. Day after day, her worry turned into grief—and then into anger—until she
          learned the truth: Hades had taken Persephone to be his queen. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
        </p>

        <p>
          Heartbroken and furious, Demeter abandoned her duties as goddess of the harvest. Without her care, crops
          withered and died. Fields that were once green turned dry and lifeless, and a terrible
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A severe shortage of food.">famine</span>
          spread across the land. People suffered, and even the gods realized the world could not survive this way. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
        </p>

        <p>
          Zeus finally intervened. He sent Hermes to the underworld to bring Persephone back. Hades agreed, but before
          Persephone left, he tricked her into eating seeds from a pomegranate. Because she had eaten food from the
          underworld, she could not leave forever. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
        </p>

        <p>
          A compromise was made: Persephone would spend part of the year with Demeter on Earth and part of the year in
          the underworld with Hades. When Persephone returned, Demeter’s joy made the earth flourish—spring and summer.
          When Persephone left, Demeter mourned, and the land grew cold and barren—fall and winter. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
        </p>

        <p>
          This myth shows how powerful Demeter’s love is. Her emotions didn’t just affect her family—they shaped the
          seasons and the survival of the entire world.

    <section class="card full" aria-label="Story 2" id="story2">
      <div class="section">
        <h2><center>Demeter and the People of Eleusis</center></h2>

        <p>
          After Persephone was taken, Demeter wandered the earth in disguise, searching for her daughter.
          Weary and heartbroken, she arrived in the city of Eleusis, taking the form of an old woman.
          She rested by a well until she was approached by the daughters of King Celeus, who invited her home. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
        </p>

        <p>
          Queen Metaneira welcomed the stranger and offered her shelter. In gratitude, Demeter cared for the queen’s
          infant son, Demophon. Demeter grew fond of him and decided to make him immortal by placing him in a sacred
          fire each night, burning away his mortality. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
        </p>

        <p>
          One night, Queen Metaneira saw the child in the fire and screamed, believing Demeter meant to harm him.
          Demeter, angered by the interruption, revealed her true form, shining with divine power. She explained
          that Demophon had nearly become immortal—but the process had been ruined. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
        </p>

        <p>
          Even so, Demeter did not punish Eleusis. Instead, she instructed the people to build a great temple in her
          honor and taught them sacred rites that later became the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Secret religious ceremonies in Eleusis honoring Demeter and Persephone.">Eleusinian Mysteries</span>,
          one of the most important religious ceremonies in ancient Greece. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
        </p>

        <p>
          These mysteries celebrated the cycle of life, death, and rebirth—mirroring Demeter’s sorrow and joy as
          Persephone traveled between the underworld and the earth. The people honored Demeter for generations, and
          her blessings kept their fields fertile and harvests abundant. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

    <section class="card full" aria-label="Story 3" id="story3">
      <div class="section">
        <h2><center>Poseidon and the Creation of Horses</center></h2>

        <p>
          In one myth, Poseidon became obsessed with Demeter and tried to win her affection. Demeter did not return
          his feelings and wanted to escape his attention. To distract him, she challenged Poseidon with an
          “impossible” task: create the most beautiful creature the world had ever seen. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
        </p>

        <p>
          Poseidon, determined to impress Demeter, began shaping animals from sea foam and earth. He created strange
          creatures and experimented again and again, but none felt perfect. Finally, he formed a powerful animal
          with a flowing mane and strong legs—the first horse. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
        </p>

        <p>
          The horse galloped across the land, swift and noble. Even though Demeter still did not love Poseidon, the
          new creature became an important part of the human world—helping people travel, farm, and fight.
          Poseidon became closely associated with horses and was sometimes called the “Tamer of Horses.” :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
        </p>

        <p>
          This story still connects back to Demeter because it highlights something important about her: she did not
          simply give in to pressure. Demeter guarded her independence, even when another powerful god demanded her
          attention.

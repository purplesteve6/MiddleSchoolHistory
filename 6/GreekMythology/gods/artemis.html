        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          Artemis was the Greek goddess of the hunt, the wilderness, wild animals, childbirth, and the moon.
          She was the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo. According to myth, Artemis was
          born first and then helped her mother deliver Apollo. Because of this, she became connected to
          childbirth and the care of young children.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artemis was a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A goddess who swears never to marry.">virgin goddess</span>
          who chose independence. She lived in forests and mountains, hunting with her silver bow and arrows,
          often traveling with a group of
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Nature spirits connected to forests, rivers, mountains, and trees.">nymphs</span>.
          Artemis protected young girls and punished people who harmed women or animals. But she could also be
          intense and
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Wanting to punish someone for disrespect or wrongdoing.">vengeful</span>
          when her rules were broken.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artemis was deeply connected to nature and was believed to bring both life and death. She protected
          wild animals, yet she was also a skilled hunter. Over time, she became linked to the moon, taking on a
          role similar to the Titan goddess

        <h2><center>The Birth of Artemis and Apollo</center></h2>

        <p>
          Leto, a kind and gentle
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A powerful female Titan (an older generation of gods).">Titaness</span>,
          was expecting twins—the children of Zeus. But Zeus’s wife Hera was furious. She declared that no land
          under the sun could offer Leto a place to give birth. Desperate and in pain, Leto wandered the world,
          searching for safety.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a long journey, Leto found the floating island of Delos. It was small and rocky, drifting on
          the sea and not firmly connected to the earth. Because of this, it was not bound by Hera’s curse.
          Leto begged the island to shelter her, promising that her children would bring it honor. Delos agreed,
          and the island became rooted to the ocean floor—finally still and strong.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hera tried to make things even worse by keeping
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The goddess of childbirth in Greek mythology.">Eileithyia</span>
          away. Without her help, Leto suffered in labor for nine long days and nights. The other goddesses took
          pity and secretly brought Eileithyia to Delos. At last, Leto could give birth.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, Leto gave birth to Artemis. Myths often describe Artemis as strong and independent from the very
          beginning. Then—because she understood her mother’s pain—Artemis helped Leto as she delivered Apollo.
          This is one reason Artemis became associated with childbirth and protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Apollo was born, the island seemed to glow with golden light, and the world rejoiced. The twins
          would grow into powerful Olympians: Apollo connected with music and prophecy, and Artemis connected
          with the moon, nature, and the hunt. Their bond began on Delos—an island forever remembered as their
          birthplace.

        <h2><center>Actaeon’s Punishment</center></h2>

        <p>
          Actaeon was a skilled hunter who loved exploring deep forests with his pack of hunting dogs. One day,
          after a long morning of chasing deer, he wandered away from his friends. As he moved through the trees,
          he came upon a sparkling hidden spring—without realizing Artemis and her nymphs were bathing there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artemis valued privacy and had set clear
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A limit or rule that should be respected.">boundaries</span>.
          No mortal was supposed to see her bathing. But Actaeon—without meaning to—broke that rule. The nymphs
          gasped and tried to cover Artemis, but Artemis saw Actaeon staring in shock.
        </p>

        <p>
          Artemis’s anger flared. “How dare you look upon me!” she cried. Even though Actaeon had not planned it,
          Artemis decided the disrespect could not be ignored. She splashed water at him and declared,
          “Since you love to hunt, you shall become the hunted!”
        </p>

        <p>
          Actaeon’s body changed: his hands became legs, his fingers turned to hooves, and his skin became fur.
          He tried to speak, but only a frightened stag’s cry came out. Artemis had turned him into a deer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Terrified, Actaeon ran, but his own hunting dogs caught his scent. They did not recognize their master.
          The dogs chased him down, and the hunter became the hunted. In the end, Actaeon’s fate became a warning:
          Artemis protected her honor and expected her rules to be respected.

        <h2><center>Orion’s Fate</center></h2>

        <p>
          Orion was a mighty hunter, famous for his strength and skill. Some myths say he was the son of
          Poseidon and could even walk on water. Wherever he went, people admired him, calling him one of the
          greatest hunters alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Orion met Artemis, and they bonded over their love of the wild. They hunted together and spent long
          days exploring forests and mountains. Some stories describe them as close friends, while others claim
          Orion wanted to marry Artemis. But Artemis had sworn never to marry, and Apollo did not trust Orion.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are different versions of Orion’s end. In one, Orion became arrogant and claimed he would hunt
          every animal on Earth. This angered
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The earth goddess in Greek myth; a powerful ancient deity.">Gaia</span>,
          who sent a giant scorpion to stop him. Orion fought bravely, but the scorpion’s sting was deadly.
        </p>

        <p>
          In another version, Apollo feared Artemis was growing too fond of Orion. One day Orion swam far out
          into the sea. Apollo pointed to a small dark shape in the water and challenged Artemis to hit it with
          her bow. Not knowing it was Orion, Artemis fired—and her arrow struck true. When she realized what
          happened, Artemis was heartbroken.
        </p>

        <p>
          To honor Orion, Artemis placed him among the stars as a bright
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A group of stars that forms a picture in the sky.">constellation</span>.
          Even today, Orion shines in the night sky—while the scorpion still follows, forever chasing him across
          the heavens.

        <h2><center>Iphigenia’s Rescue</center></h2>

        <p>
          King Agamemnon was preparing to sail to Troy, but the winds would not blow. The sea stayed calm, and
          the ships could not move. Artemis was angry because Agamemnon had killed one of her sacred deer and
          bragged that he was a better hunter than she was. To punish him, Artemis stopped the winds and held
          the entire Greek fleet in place.
        </p>

        <p>
          Desperate, Agamemnon asked the priests what to do. They claimed Artemis demanded a terrible sacrifice:
          his daughter, Iphigenia. Agamemnon hesitated, but he feared losing the war before it even began.
          He sent for Iphigenia, tricking her family by saying she would marry Achilles.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Iphigenia arrived and learned the truth, she was terrified. The priests prepared the altar and
          led her forward. At the last moment, Artemis decided what kind of goddess she would be in this story:
          not only a punisher, but also a protector.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a flash of divine power, Artemis replaced Iphigenia with a deer and carried the girl away to safety.
          The winds returned, and the Greeks sailed to Troy—believing Iphigenia was gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Artemis had spared her. She took Iphigenia to a distant land and made her a priestess in Artemis’s
          temple. The myth reminds readers that Artemis could be strict and demanding, but she could also show
          mercy when she chose.

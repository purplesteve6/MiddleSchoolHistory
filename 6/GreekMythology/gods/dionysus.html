        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          Dionysus was the Greek god of wine, celebration, and theater. He represented joy, music, dance, and freedom,
          but also madness and loss of control. Unlike many Olympians, Dionysus had a mortal parent, which made him
          closely connected to human emotions and experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          His birth was unusual. His mother, Semele, was a mortal who was tricked by Hera into asking Zeus to reveal
          his true form. The divine power destroyed her, but Zeus saved the unborn Dionysus by sewing him into his
          thigh until he was ready to be born. Because of this, Dionysus was known as the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Born twice; once from a mortal mother and once from Zeus.">twice-born</span>
          god.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dionysus traveled the world teaching people how to grow grapes and make wine. He was followed by satyrs and
          Maenads—wild followers who worshiped him through dancing, singing, and celebration. While he rewarded
          those who honored him, he punished anyone who denied his divinity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dionysus was also the god of theater. Greek plays were performed at festivals held in his honor, and his
          influence shaped drama, storytelling, and performance. His symbols included grapevines, ivy, and the
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A staff wrapped in ivy and topped with a pinecone.">thyrsus</span>.

        <h2><center>The Birth of Dionysus</center></h2>

        <p>
          Dionysus was born to Zeus and a mortal woman named Semele. Hera, jealous of the affair, tricked Semele into
          asking Zeus to reveal his true godly form. Bound by an oath, Zeus had no choice. When he appeared surrounded
          by lightning and fire, Semele was destroyed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zeus saved the unborn child and sewed him into his thigh until he was ready to be born. When Dionysus
          emerged, he became known as the twice-born god, belonging to both the mortal and divine worlds.
        </p>

        <p>
          To protect him from Hera, Zeus hid Dionysus with nymphs. This strange beginning shaped Dionysus into a god
          who understood both joy and suffering.

        <h2><center>Dionysus and the Pirates</center></h2>

        <p>
          Pirates once captured Dionysus, believing he was a wealthy prince. As they sailed away, vines grew across
          the ship and wine flowed over the deck. The terrified crew realized too late that they had angered a god.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dionysus transformed into a roaring lion, and the pirates leapt into the sea. Instead of drowning, they
          were turned into dolphins. Only the helmsman, who had warned the others, was spared.
        </p>

        <p>
          The story showed Dionysus’s power—and reminded mortals to respect the gods.

        <h2><center>King Pentheus and the Maenads</center></h2>

        <p>
          King Pentheus of Thebes refused to believe Dionysus was a god and tried to stop his followers. Dionysus
          allowed himself to be captured, but no prison could hold him.
        </p>

        <p>
          Disguised, Pentheus spied on the Maenads, but Dionysus clouded his mind. The Maenads, including Pentheus’s
          own mother, mistook him for an animal and killed him in a frenzy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The story warned that denying Dionysus—and suppressing joy and freedom—could lead to terrible consequences.

        <p>
          Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos. Dionysus found her and offered love instead of
          betrayal. He married her and made her immortal.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a gift, Dionysus placed her crown in the sky as a constellation. Ariadne’s story showed Dionysus as a god
          who rewarded loyalty and healed broken hearts.

        <p>
          King Midas welcomed one of Dionysus’s companions and was rewarded with a wish. Greedy for wealth, he asked
          that everything he touched turn to gold.
        </p>

        <p>
          The gift quickly became a curse—food, drink, and even his daughter turned to gold. Horrified, Midas begged
          Dionysus for mercy. Dionysus told him to wash in a river, removing the curse.
        </p>

        <p>
          The myth taught that desire without wisdom can destroy happiness.

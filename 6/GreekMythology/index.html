        <p>
          Greek mythology is a collection of myths and legends that the ancient Greeks used to explain their world.
          These stories feature powerful gods and goddesses, heroic mortals, and mythical creatures, all woven into tales
          of adventure, love, and conflict. At the heart of these myths are the Olympians, a
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A group of gods or goddesses.">pantheon</span>
          of deities who ruled from
          <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The legendary home of the Olympian gods.">Mount Olympus</span>
          and played crucial roles in shaping the fate of both gods and humans. Greek mythology has influenced art, literature,
          and culture for thousands of years, with its themes still resonating in modern storytelling. Whether through epic battles,
          divine rivalries, or quests for glory, these myths provide a fascinating glimpse into the beliefs and imagination of ancient Greece.

              A long time ago, before the world existed, there was only
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Emptiness; the dark and endless void before the world existed.">Chaos</span>.
              Chaos wasn’t a person or a god—it was just emptiness, a dark and endless void. But from this nothingness,
              things began to take shape.
            </p>
            <p>
              First came
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The Earth; one of the first beings in Greek creation stories.">Gaia</span>,
              the Earth. She was strong and steady, the foundation for everything that would come after. Then came
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A deep, shadowy underworld beneath the earth.">Tartarus</span>,
              the deep and shadowy underworld far below the earth. Next was
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The force of love that brings things together.">Eros</span>,
              the force of love, who helped bring things together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gaia didn’t need anyone to help her create. On her own, she gave birth to
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The sky; Gaia’s child and later her husband in Greek myth.">Uranus</span>,
              the sky, who stretched out above her like a vast dome. She also created the mountains and Pontus, the sea.
              Uranus became her husband, and together, they had many children. Their most important children were the
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Powerful beings who ruled before the Olympian gods.">Titans</span>,
              powerful and massive beings who ruled the world before the gods of Olympus.
            </p>
            <p>
              But Uranus was not a kind father. He feared that his children might one day take his power, so he locked some of them deep inside Gaia,
              causing her great pain. She grew angry and planned to stop him. She asked her children for help, but only one was brave enough—Cronus,
              the youngest and most ambitious Titan.

              a sharp sickle, and one night, when Uranus came close, Cronus struck him, wounding him terribly. With Uranus weakened,
              Cronus and his siblings were free. But as Uranus fell, he warned Cronus that one day, he too would be overthrown by his own child.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that Uranus was gone, Cronus became the ruler of the world. He freed his brothers and sisters, and the Titans took control.
              This was known as the Age of the Titans, a time before the famous gods like Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cronus married his sister
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="A Titaness and mother of Zeus.">Rhea</span>,
              and together they had many children. But he remembered Uranus’s warning. Fearing that one of his own children would take his throne,
              Cronus made a terrible decision—every time Rhea gave birth, he swallowed the baby whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rhea was heartbroken, but she had a plan. When her youngest son,
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="King of the Olympian gods; ruler of the sky.">Zeus</span>,
              was born, she tricked Cronus by giving him a rock wrapped in a blanket instead of the baby. Zeus was hidden away, growing strong,
              waiting for the day he would challenge his father and change the world forever.

              Zeus grew up in secret, hidden away by his mother, Rhea, so that Cronus would not swallow him like his siblings. He was raised in a distant cave,
              cared for by nymphs and fed by Amalthea, a magical goat whose milk made him strong. As he grew older, he knew he had to challenge his father
              and free his brothers and sisters.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the help of Metis, a wise Titaness, Zeus tricked Cronus into drinking a special potion. The potion made Cronus vomit up all the children he had
              swallowed—Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Now fully grown, Zeus and his siblings were ready to fight.
            </p>
            <p>
              This led to the
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="The great war between the Titans (Cronus) and the younger gods (Zeus).">Titanomachy</span>,
              a great war between the Titans, led by Cronus, and the younger gods, led by Zeus. The battle raged for ten years, shaking the heavens and the earth.
              The Titans were strong, but Zeus and his siblings had powerful allies. They freed the
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Giant one-eyed beings in Greek myth.">Cyclopes</span>
              and the
              <span class="vocabWord" data-def="Giants with a hundred arms.">Hecatoncheires</span>—giants with a hundred arms—from the depths of Tartarus.
              In gratitude, the Cyclopes gave Zeus his mighty thunderbolt, Poseidon his trident, and Hades a helmet of invisibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              With their new weapons, the gods turned the tide of the battle. The Hecatoncheires hurled massive boulders at the Titans, while Zeus struck with his thunderbolts,
              shaking the sky. Finally, Zeus defeated Cronus and cast him, along with most of the Titans, into Tartarus, locking them away forever behind massive bronze gates
              guarded by the Hecatoncheires.
            </p>
            <p>
              After their victory, Zeus and his brothers divided the cosmos among themselves. Zeus became the ruler of the sky and the king of the gods, seated on Mount Olympus.
              Poseidon took control of the seas, ruling over the vast waters. Hades became the lord of the underworld, overseeing the realm of the dead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zeus established his rule over the heavens and all of existence, bringing order where there had been chaos. He built a great palace on Mount Olympus, where the gods would live
              and govern the world. But his rule was not without challenges—giants and monsters still roamed, and even his fellow gods sometimes questioned his authority.
              Yet Zeus, with his thunderbolt in hand, remained the supreme ruler, ensuring that the new order of gods, known as the Olympians, would last for generations.

        <h2>The 12 Olympians &amp; Mount Olympus</h2>

        <p>
          The Olympians were the principal deities of Greek mythology, ruling over the cosmos from their celestial home on Mount Olympus. These gods and goddesses held dominion over various
          aspects of life, from wisdom and war to love and the sea. Zeus, the king of the gods, ruled alongside his siblings and children, each of whom played a vital role in Greek mythology.
          The Olympians were both revered and feared, as their favor could bring prosperity, while their wrath could spell disaster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece, was believed to be an otherworldly realm where the gods feasted, debated, and watched over mortals. Unlike the mortal world, Olympus was a
          place of eternal grandeur, untouched by time and decay. It was said that only the divine could dwell there, and even heroes who achieved greatness in life were rarely granted entrance.
          This legendary mountain remains a powerful symbol of divine authority and the rich tapestry of Greek mythology.
